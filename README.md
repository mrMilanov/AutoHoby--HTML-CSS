# AutoHoby--HTML-CSS
This is one of my early HTML projects, where I created a simple automobile catalog.
The catalog displays basic information about various cars, such as horsepower (HP), weight, acceleration, and other key specifications.

Project Structure:
Home Page (Catalog): A list of several automobiles, each with basic details like HP, weight, and acceleration.
Short History: A separate page that presents some interesting historical facts about automobiles.
Contact Page: A basic form for user feedback (non-functional), with an embedded Google Map.
This project serves as a learning experience and demonstrates my initial steps in web development, focusing on HTML structure and simple page linking.
