# AutoHoby--HTML-CSS
Basic HTML/CSS project

This is one of my first HTML projects.
In this one I tried to make an auto catalog with several automobiles and their basic info like (HP; Weight; Acceleration and ect.)
The other pages are:
(Short history) where I found some interesting info to place.
(Contact page) is just a basic form which doesn't work, and i have put a google map.
